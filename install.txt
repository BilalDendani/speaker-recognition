* Open terminal (command prompt on windows).
* Make sure you have python3 installed. Run: [python3 --version ] to check.
* Make sure you have virtualenv installed. 
    + Run: [pip install virtualenv ]
    + Run: [virtualenv --version ]
* cd to a dir under which you want to create this project's dir. example: ~/projects
* run: [git clone https://github.com/manishpandit/speaker-recognition.git ]. This will create a speaker-recognition dir.
* run: [cd speaker-recognition ].
* Download raw_data.zip file 
    from GDrive [https://drive.google.com/file/d/1qvS8u78PzMXeek3kIgJnLG-7y-JlpMM_/view?usp=sharing]
* Move raw_data.zip to project's /res folder and unzip. This should create a subfolder 
    called /raw_data under /res. The folder structure should 
    look like res/raw_data/anthonyschaller-20071221- etc.
* For the following instructions, start from speaker-recognition dir 
* run: [virtualenv -p python3 . ] (include the dot). This will create virtual env.
* run: [pip install -r requirements.txt ]. This will install all the required packages.
* run: [source bin/activate ]. Notice your prompt changed. Everytime you work with this project
    you should run this command. When you are done, run: [deactivate ].
* The res/raw_data folder should be empty. This is where the VoxForge dataset resides. 
    I decided to exclude it since it is very large.
* run: [cd code]. All the python files are meant to be run from /code folder.
* run: [python3 voxforge.py ]. This will create h5 file from raw_data.
* You can run: [python3 cnn_train.py ] to train the model. 
* You can run: [python3 cnn_test.py ] to test the model.
